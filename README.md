# POWER_BI---ATLIQ-BUSINESS-INSIGHT-360

⬇ Let me share my experience while working on this BI360 project ⬇

Through this project, I discovered the significance of soft skills in meeting business expectations. Initially, we constructed dashboards that compared actuals with the previous year. However, the business desired to assess whether the set target goals were being achieved. While working on the targets, this revelation added a meaningful twist to our insights. We reconstructed and updated the dashboards based on the feedback received. This experience taught me that asking the right and significant questions is essential for generating insightful analysis. It also deepened my understanding of how business management teams approach problem-solving.
